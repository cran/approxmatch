Description: Tools for constructing a matched design with multiple comparison groups.
 Further specifications of refined covariate balance restriction and exact match on 
 covariate can be imposed. Matches are approximately optimal in  the sense that the 
 cost of the solution is at most twice the optimal cost, Crama and Spieksma (1992)
